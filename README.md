**Telnet Password**

To use, download the file, make it executable and run

chmod +x telnet-password

sh ./telnet-password

**Purpose**

This small bash script generates a password to use when you login to a Synology NAS via telnet.
Telnet is used in 'last ditch' recovery for your NAS, if the generated password doesn't work, try '101-0101' which is the default.
